### For Intune Deployment

1. Package this entire directory using the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool
2. Upload the .intunewin file to Intune
3. Configure the application with these settings:

> **Company Portal Assets**: The `assets` folder contains icons and description content you can use when publishing your app in the Company Portal. This helps provide a professional and consistent appearance for end-users.
   - **Standard installation command:** 
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml"
   ```

   - **Installation command with consumer Office removal:** 
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml" -RemoveConsumerOffice
   ```

   - **Installation command that forces installation even if Office is already installed:**
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml" -Force
   ```

   - **Installation command that uninstalls existing Office products first:**
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml" -UninstallExisting
   ```

   - **Uninstall command:** 
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\uninstall-office365.xml"
   ```

   - **For Visio installation:**
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-visio.xml"
   ```

   - **For Project installation:**
   
   ```powershell
   PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1" -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-project.xml"
   ```

   - **Detection method:** 
      - Registry key for Microsoft 365 Apps
      - **Rule Type:** `Registry`
      - **Key Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\O365BusinessRetail - en-us`
      - **Value Name:** `DisplayName`
      - **Detection Method:** `Value exists`
      - **Associated with a 32-bit app on 64-bit clients:** `No`
      
      > **Important Note:** You must update the Key Path to match the specific product you are installing. For example:
      > - For Visio: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\VisioProRetail - en-us`
      > - For Project: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\ProjectProRetail - en-us`
      > 
      > Also note that the language code (`en-us` in the examples) should match the language you're deploying.

## Product Detection

The script includes a comprehensive `Test-ProductInstalled` function that detects:

- Microsoft 365 Apps (various SKUs)
- Office 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2024 products (Retail & Volume)
- Visio 2010-2024 (Standard and Professional editions)
- Project 2010-2024 (Standard and Professional editions)
- Installations in multiple languages
- Various registry locations for complete coverage
- Click-to-Run installations via configuration keys
- Office application executable paths
- Office install root registry keys
- Generic detection through uninstall registry entries

The detection logic uses multiple methods to ensure the most accurate results, including:
1. Product-specific uninstall registry keys
2. Click-to-Run configuration detection
3. Office application executable paths
4. Office install root registry keys
5. Generic search through uninstall registry entries

## Consumer Office Detection and Removal

The script now includes enhanced functionality to detect and remove pre-installed consumer versions of Office that often come on OEM Windows installations. This helps prevent conflicts and ensures a clean installation environment - a common challenge for MSPs and IT departments dealing with new devices.

The consumer Office detection and removal functionality:

- Detects Home & Student, Personal, and OEM versions of Office
- Identifies Microsoft Store Office apps
- Automatically removes them using the Office Deployment Tool
- Provides detailed logging of the removal process
- Continues with installation even if some components can't be fully removed

To use this feature, simply add the `-RemoveConsumerOffice` switch to your installation command:

```powershell
# Example for direct execution or RMM deployment
.\Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1 -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml" -RemoveConsumerOffice

# Example with additional options for automated deployment
.\Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1 -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml" -RemoveConsumerOffice -OfficeInstallDownloadPath "C:\Temp\OfficeInstall"
```

This feature is particularly valuable for:
- Client onboarding scenarios
- New device deployments
- Standardizing environments across multiple clients
- Transitioning from consumer to business Microsoft 365 subscriptions

## Installation Options

The script supports several installation modes to handle different scenarios:

- **Default behavior**: Checks if Office is installed and skips installation if detected
- **Force Installation**: Uses the `-Force` parameter to explicitly force installation even if Office is already detected
- **Uninstall Existing**: Uses the `-UninstallExisting` parameter to remove existing Office products before installation
- **Skip If Installed**: Uses the `-SkipIfInstalled` parameter to explicitly skip installation if Office is detected (same as default behavior, but makes intent explicit)
- **Detection Only**: Uses the `-DetectOnly` parameter to only check for Office products without installing (useful for inventory)

Example usage:

```powershell
# Only detect Office products and report findings (useful for inventory)
.\Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1 -DetectOnly

# Uninstall existing Office products before installing new ones
.\Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1 -UninstallExisting -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml"

# Force installation even if Office is already installed
.\Install-Microsoft365Apps.ps1 -Force -ConfigXMLPath "config\install-office365.xml"
```

## Troubleshooting

Installation logs are saved in the system temp directory with the naming pattern:
`Office365Install_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

These logs contain detailed information about each step of the installation process and any errors that may have occurred.

## Integration and Branding

The `assets` folder contains resources you can use in various deployment scenarios:

- **Icons**: High-quality application icons for Microsoft 365 Apps, Visio, and Project
- **Description Files**: Ready-to-use description text for each application

These assets help create a more professional and consistent experience for end users, whether you're:

- Creating documentation for clients
- Building a self-service portal
- Configuring Intune Company Portal listings
- Adding applications to SCCM Software Center
- Creating custom deployment notifications
